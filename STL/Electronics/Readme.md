### Electronics Mounting

- I used M5 drop-in T-nuts and M5Ã—16mm screws for the mounts
- I removed the welded mounts for the MKS Gen L and used a printed mount. This gave access to the USB port to be able to keep everything underneath.
- Don't forget your common ground between the 24V power and 5V power supplies
