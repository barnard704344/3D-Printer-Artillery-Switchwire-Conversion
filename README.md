# ArtilleryX1-Switchwire

Repository to document my journey to convert my X1 to a Voron switchwire

STL's are largely complete, just a few final tests on the HDMI screen holder. I have sourced/updated, created everything needed to print out, with the exception of the stealthburner.
Which is here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner
You will also need the BTT cable holders for the canbus cable:
